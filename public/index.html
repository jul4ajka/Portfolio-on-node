            <hr>
            <p>I was born in March, 13 1989. My hometown is Lviv, UA. I was an active and curious child, who liked to read a lot and play computer games. As any of as I went to school. Actually, to gymnasium. In high school I've been studing deeper mathematics and physics. After school graduation I enter university to study ecology. While studing at university I traveled around the Europe. I've been to Austria, Chech Republic, Germany and Italy. I took part at numerous conferences about philosophy and ecology, also workshops about water pollutions. After graduaton from university I started to work. I have many different jobs in different fields, but my passion always been to work for IT company. So thats why I choose Soft Serve as a company for my own development.

            When I was very child I dream to live and work in California, USA. I love its architecture, warm climate, ocean, beaches and all this houses on the hills. I know that there is an Californian office of Soft Serve, so I want to work hard to have a chance to travel to Aliso Viejo, CA.

            Wish everybody good luck, work hard and move further!</p>
